## The Idea

This project comes from a university course aimed at teaching graphql. With the other project members, we decided to create a messenger application that can only send GIFs (regnessem = messenger backward)

## The implementation

The front was built using React and the backend uses [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) (you can see the backend repository [here](https://github.com/MGTek5/Regneback)).
We used [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com) for the styling.
Subscriptions were used to implement the realtime messaging.
