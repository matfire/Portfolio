## The Idea

During a school project to learn about Mobile development, we decided to build a movie review application using Flutter and deployed using [CodeMagic](https://codemagic.io/).

## The implementation

The application was build using Flutter and retrieved the movie information from [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). All the account data and reviews were stored in a MongoDB database and accessed using a REST API built with ExpressJS.
