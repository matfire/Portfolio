Vivi was the culmination of a 5 year masters degree program at [Epitech](https://epitech.eu). With a team of 6 other students, we managed to build a user-friendly router and centralized interface aimed toward event organizers.

## Features

- Plug and Play
- Ban devices
- Restrict authorized domains / ip addresses
- Save router configuration (banned devices and domains)
- Load configuration on another router

## The router

During the development phase the router was based on a Raspberry PI 4 with some customized tooling. The purpose of this object was to be placed at the root of a LAN (we did not support WAN and acting as a bridge between the two) and would be the one in charge of distributing IPv4 addresses and route traffic to the "real router" (or elsewhere)
